# üêæ Veterinarian Clinic System ‚Äì C Final Project

This project is a **Veterinary Clinic Appointment Management System** developed in **C**, as part of the final assignment for the **BTP144 (C Programming)** course at **Seneca College**.

The system manages **patient contact information** and **appointment scheduling** for a veterinary clinic. The project is developed incrementally in **three milestones**, each building on the last to achieve a complete and functional solution.
